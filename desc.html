<div class="claim"> <div class="claim" id="CLM-00001" num="00001">
<div class="claim-text">1. A system for capturing images, comprising:
<div class="claim-text">a camera apparatus, the camera apparatus including:
<div class="claim-text">a first camera configured to capture a first image; and</div>
<div class="claim-text">a second camera configured to capture a second image; and</div>
</div>
<div class="claim-text">a controller in communication with the camera apparatus configured to:
<div class="claim-text">receive a velocity of a movable structure, the velocity of the movable structure corresponding to a movement of the camera apparatus at a given speed; and</div>
<div class="claim-text">while moving the camera apparatus at the given speed:
<div class="claim-text">start to expose the first image using the first camera at a time T<b>1</b>;</div>
<div class="claim-text">start to expose the second image using the second camera at a time T<b>2</b>, wherein T<b>2</b> is after T<b>1</b>; and</div>
<div class="claim-text">complete exposure of the first image at a time T<b>3</b> after the time T<b>2</b> such that the first image and the second image include overlapping fields of view captured by the camera apparatus between time T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b>,</div>
<div class="claim-text">wherein a same object at a same location within the first and second images is captured by each of the first and second cameras at different times due to the movement of the camera apparatus.</div>

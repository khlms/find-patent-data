"1. A system for capturing images, comprising:
a camera apparatus, the camera apparatus including:
a first camera configured to capture a first image; and
a second camera configured to capture a second image; and

a controller in communication with the camera apparatus configured to:
receive a velocity of a movable structure, the velocity of the movable structure corresponding to a movement of the camera apparatus at a given speed; and
while moving the camera apparatus at the given speed:
start to expose the first image using the first camera at a time T1;
start to expose the second image using the second camera at a time T2, wherein T2 is after T1; and
complete exposure of the first image at a time T3 after the time T2 such that the first image and the second image include overlapping fields of view captured by the camera apparatus between time T2 and T3,
wherein a same object at a same location within the first and second images is captured by each of the first and second cameras at different times due to the movement of the camera apparatus."
"2. The system for capturing images of claim 1, wherein a delay time determined by the controller is due to a distance between entrance pupils of the first and second cameras and is offset based on the velocity of the system."
"3. The system for capturing images of claim 1, wherein a delay time determined by the controller is due to a distance between entrance pupils of the first and second cameras and is offset based on an average velocity of the system."
"4. The system for capturing images of claim 1, wherein prior to start exposing the second image, the controller is configured to determine the time T2 based on the given speed."
"5. The system for capturing images of claim 1, further comprising the controller configured to complete exposure of the first image in order to reduce a likelihood that an object in the overlapping fields of view has moved between times T2 and T3."
"6. The system for capturing images of claim 1, wherein the velocity value of the system is determined in real-time based at least in part, on data from a GPS sensor affixed to the system, a speedometer of the system, or a wheel encoder that detects movement of a wheel of the system."
"7. The system for capturing images of claim 2, wherein the camera apparatus includes a set of cameras including the first and second cameras, and while moving the camera apparatus, capturing additional images using the set of cameras where each additional image has an overlapping field of view with at least one other of the additional images."
"8. The system for capturing images of claim 1, wherein the first camera includes a first image sensor and the second camera includes a second image sensor and different portions of the first and second image sensors are exposed at different times in order to capture the first and second images."
"9. The system for capturing images of claim 1, wherein the first and second cameras each includes a set of photodiode columns arranged in a portrait orientation relative to a ground surface."
"10. The system for capturing images of claim 7, wherein the delay time offset applies to cameras of the set of cameras pointed sideways from a motion of the system."
"11. The system for capturing images of claim 1, wherein the camera apparatus is configured to capture a panoramic image."
"12. The system for capturing images of claim 1, wherein a difference in time between T2 and T3 is proportionate to a size of the overlapping fields of view."
"13. The system of claim 1, further comprising the movable structure, and wherein the camera apparatus is attached to the movable structure, and wherein movement of the movable structure causes the camera apparatus to move."
"14. The system of claim 13, wherein the movable structure is a vehicle."
"15. The system of claim 14, wherein the camera apparatus is attached to a top portion of the vehicle."
"16. The system of claim 1, wherein the first camera and the second camera are arranged as a camera rosette."
"17. The system of claim 16, wherein the first camera and the second camera are adjacent to one another in the rosette."
"18. The system of claim 16, wherein each camera of the rosette includes a rolling-shutter image sensor arranged in a portrait orientation."
"19. The system of claim 16, wherein each camera of the rosette includes a rolling-shutter image sensor arranged in a landscape orientation."
"20. The system of claim 16, wherein the rosette includes at least eight cameras, and wherein the eight cameras includes the first camera and the second camera."
